## Hello fellas :wave:
### I'm **Siddhant**

A first year student at ***Manipal University Jaipur.***
I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
***
I love Coding :computer:. I fell in love with technology when I was a child and this is what helped me in developing a keen interest in Programming and Software development. I'm always eager to learn something new and build something practical out of it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects using **Java** <img src="https://github.com/Geralt-Of-Rivia-Witcher/Geralt-Of-Rivia-Witcher/blob/main/java.png" width="30" height="30">.
- ðŸŒ± I'm also learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** and exploring the field of **Web Development** <img src="https://github.com/Geralt-Of-Rivia-Witcher/Geralt-Of-Rivia-Witcher/blob/main/web.png" width="30" height="30">.

Apart from writing codes, I love getting lost in the virtual world of Video Games :video_game:.
