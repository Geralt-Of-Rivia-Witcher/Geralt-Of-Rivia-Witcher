I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

I love Coding :computer:. I fell in love with technology when I was a child and this is what helped me in developing a keen interest in Programming and Software development. I'm always eager to learn something new and build something practical out of it.
